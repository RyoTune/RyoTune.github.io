Most mods usually rely on another mod to work. Adding a **Mod Dependency** on that mod will let
**Reloaded** automatically install and enable it when people use your mod.

<Aside>
  A __Mod Dependency__ can only be added on mods that are installed. Make sure
  the mod you want to add as a __Mod Dependency__ is __already__ installed.

## Common Mod Dependencies

## Steps

1. You can add **Mod Dependencies** when creating a mod or by right-clicking an existing mod in the **Mods List** and selecting **Edit Mod**.

<Image
  src={img_re_mods_edit}
  alt="Edit a mod by right-clicking it in the Mods List."
/>

<Image src={img_re_create_dep} alt="Creating a Mod, adding mod dependencies." />

2. Select any mods your mod relies on to add them as a **Mod Dependency**.

<Image src={img_re_add_dep} alt="Adding a mod dependency." />

3. Once you're finished, close the window.

<Image src={img_re_add_dep_close} alt="Close Mod Dependencies window." />

4. **Restart Reloaded!** Mod dependency data is only **fully added** during **start-up**, so it's better to do it now instead of later.

5. Finished! ðŸŽ‰
