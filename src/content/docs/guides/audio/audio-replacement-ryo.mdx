## Requirements

<ModInfoContainer mod={Mod_Ryo} />

## Create a Ryo Mod

1. In **Reloaded**, [create a new mod](/guides/reloaded/01-create-mod) and enable it.

2. [Add a **Mod Dependency**](/guides/reloaded/02-mod-dependency) on **{Mod_Ryo.name}**.

3. Open your mod's folder.

<Image src={img_ryo_mod_empty} alt="Empty Ryo mod folder." />

4. In your mod's folder, create a folder named `Ryo`.

<Image src={img_ryo_mod_with_folder} alt="Ryo mod with Ryo folder." />

5. Inside the `Ryo` folder, create a folder with the **same name** as the **game's EXE file**.

<Image src={img_ryo_mod_game_folder} alt="Ryo folder with game folder." />

6. All your **audio files** will go **inside** the **game's folder**.

## Converting Your Files

Before you can use your audio files, you'll probably need to **convert** them to a **format**
your **game supports**.

[**Yona**](/yona/installing-yona) is recommended since it includes pre-made encoders for multiple games.
[Quick Convert](/yona/quick-convert) also streamlines converting and looping multiple files at once.

If you're not sure what the correct format for your game is, check the [Game Encoders](/yona/game-encoders) page.

## Replacing Audio

**Ryo Framework** supports replacing audio played with various methods, but most supported games will be using **Cues**.

If you're not sure what your game uses, check the [Reloaded Console](/guides/reloaded/reloaded-console) with [Developer Mode](/ryo/dev-mode) enabled.

### Cues

The most common type of audio played.

To replace **Cues**, you need **two** pieces of data: the **ACB Name** it's from and its **Cue ID** or **Cue Name**.

If you don't know them, the easiest way to figure them out is get the audio to play in-game with **Ryo Framework's** [Developer Mode](/ryo/dev-mode) enabled.

#### ACB Folder

In the **game's folder**, create a folder with the **ACB Name** ending with `.acb`. This is an **ACB Folder**.

<Image src={img_ryo_acb_folder} alt="An ACB folder in the game's folder." />

In an **ACB Folder**, there are two methods to replace a **Cue**.

#### Cue File

The simplest method, just add a file named the same as the **Cue ID** or **Cue Name**.

<Image src={img_ryo_acb_cue_file} alt="Cue File in an ACB Folder." />

#### Cue Folder

_Slightly_ more advanced, but with some extra features. Create a folder named the same as the **Cue ID** or **Cue Name** ending with `.cue`. This is a **Cue Folder**.

<Image src={img_ryo_acb_cue_folder} alt="Cue Folder in an ACB Folder." />

Inside the **Cue Folder**, add your replacement file(s). In a **Cue Folder**, not only do file names not matter but adding **multiple files**
will automatically **randomize** the **Cue**.

A very easy method for adding something like **music randomization** to a game.
