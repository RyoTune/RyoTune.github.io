## Too Long/Didn't Read

1. No reposting my mods in any form or on public platforms.

2. If you **need** to share a modified version of my mod, such as if a game update breaks the released version, you are allowed to share that version privately.

3. The source code of any modified versions **must** be available publicly.

4. No making money from my mods or their source, in any form.

5. This section is not a substitute for reading and adhering to the full license.
