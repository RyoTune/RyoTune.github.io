**Yona** includes project templates that make BGM modding for supported games simple and easy.

## Requirements

<GameModSetup />

## Creating Your Mod

It's recommended to follow the official **Reloaded II** guide for
creating a mod: [https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/CreatingMods/](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/CreatingMods/)

When you get to the **Mod Dependencies** section, see below if your mod requires any other mods.

#### Mod Dependencies

## Creating Your Project

1. In the **Yona** home page, select your game's _BGM_ template. You can use the **Filter** above the templates if you can't find it.
2. In the **Create Project** window, set the **Output Folder** by clicking on the folder icon.
3. Go to where your have **Reloaded II** installed.
4. Go into the **Mods** folder then search for and open the folder with the **Mod ID** you set when creating your mod.
5. Once you're inside your mod's folder, click **Select Folder**.
6. Click **Create** in the **Create Project** window.

## Selecting Your Music

After creating your project it should've automatically opened.

1. Find the song(s) you want to replace.
2. Clicking on a song will open the **Track Panel**. In it, you can select the file to replace it and set the loop.
3. Usually your files should be **WAV** files, but any format supported by [**VGAudio**](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-audio-formats-and-containers)
   will work.
4. Loop points are set using **Samples**. A full guide to looping can be found here: [Looping Guide](https://animatedswine37.github.io/persona-modding-docs/audio/audio-formatting.html)
   - Some formats such as **HCA** and **ADX** are likely to come pre-looped.

## Building Your Project

1. After selecting your files and setting your loops, click the **Build** button in the top right.
2. Building will convert your files to ones the game can use then add them to your mod, since we set the **Output Folder** there.
3. Once you get the notification that building is finished, it's time to test your mod in-game!

Assuming you didn't get any errors, you're done! You can continue to add (or remove) any replacements in your project,
just remember to **Build** after making **_any_** changes!

<Aside type="caution" title="Fast Build">
  Do not **add** or **remove** any BGM files from your mod manually! This can
  cause issues with **Fast Build**. You can fix these issues by disabling **Fast
  Build** in your **Project Settings**, building once, then re-enabling it.
