description: Create a custom encoder for Yona.

import { Game_P5R, Game_P3R } from "../../../types/game";

**Yona** includes encoders for every format supported by **VGAudio**.
But some games might require more specific audio settings, such as **{Game_P5R.name}** and **{Game_P3R.name}**.

For games like those, you can create a **Custom Encoder** config.

## Encoder Config

**Custom Encoders** are just `.ini` files with some of the following settings set.

```
;REQUIRED
;The encoder name is how encoders are identified.
;Changing it will break any tracks using the encoder.
name=

;REQUIRED
;Examples: adx, hca
out_container_format=

out_format=
loop_alignment=
block_size=
version=
frame_size=
filter=
adx_type=
key_string=
key_code=
endianess=
hca_quality=
bitrate=
limit_bitrate=
encode_cbr=
```

Since the only encoder in **Yona** is **VGAudio** currently, the settings available are what it supports.
See the official repo for full details: [https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio)

## Creating a Custom Encoder

1. Go to: `YONA_INSTALL_FOLDER/audio/encoders/VGAudio`.
2. Create a text file in the folder and name it whatever you want **but** make sure it ends in `.ini`.
3. Open the file in your text editor.
4. Set the `name` and `out_container_format` for your encoder.
5. Set any other settings you need, such as the audio `key_code`.
6. Save your file and restart **Yona**.
7. If you haven't already, enable **Developer Mode** in **Yona's** settings.
8. Your encoder should now be available wherever an encoder can be selected, such as in the **Track Panel**.
